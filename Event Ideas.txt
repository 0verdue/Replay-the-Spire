----EVENTS----

- Gremlin Darts -
Like the Wheel of Fortune event but you can time it with a dart. Would be cool if it had more randomized rewards.

- Upgrade or Remove -
A random non-upgraded card from your deck is chosen and you are forced to either upgrade or remove it.

- Disenchanter -
You meet a disenchanter who is desparate to disenchant cards, saying he'll give you 80 gold to degrade one of your upgraded cards.

- Fishing -
Similar to the bonfire spirits. You find a pool of water, but must use one of your cards as bait.
Choosing a curse starts a fight with The Maw.
Colorless does nothing.
Common card gives a common relic.
Uncommon card gives an uncommon relic.
Rare card gives a rare relic.
