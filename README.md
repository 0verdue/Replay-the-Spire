Known Issues:
 * Cards altered by Ring of Chaos return to the normal version if the run is saved and returned to later.
 * Config settings will not save when the game is closed.
 * Potions are not seeded, and held potions may be re-rolled when the game is saved and returned to later.
 * Honey Jar + Question Card doesn't stack.
 
Changes to Existing Content:
 * Neow will now sometimes offer a random colorless card as his blessing.
 * White Beast Statue lowers the chance of finding rarer potions.
 * If you have Honey Jar and Singing Bowl at the same time, using Singing Bowl's max hp gain option also picks a reward card at random.
