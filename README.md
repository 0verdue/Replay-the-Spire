Known Issues:

 * Config settings will not save when the game is closed.
 * Potions are not seeded, and held potions may be re-rolled when the game is saved and returned to later.
 * Honey Jar + Question Card doesn't stack.
 
Changes to Existing Content:
 * Neow now has a wider variety of blessings to choose from.
 * Corpse Explosion now applies 1x Necrotic Poison rather than dealing 2x damage.
 * White Beast Statue lowers the chance of finding rarer potions.
 * If you have Honey Jar and Singing Bowl at the same time, using Singing Bowl's max hp gain option also picks a reward card at random.
