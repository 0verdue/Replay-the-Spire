Character-specific options:
 * **Ironclad:**
  * Bash -> Survivor & Neutralize
  * Burning Blood -> Self Repair+
 * **Silent:**
  * Ring of the Snake -> Sizzling Blood
  * Survivor -> Leap, Neutralize -> Beam Cell

If an upgraded card is traded for a different card using this event, the corresponding new card will be upgraded.

### Stuck
Exordium event.

A random card in the player's deck is selected as the target of this event.

Options are to either upgrade or remove the selected card.


### Trapped Chest
Any-stage event.

The player can choose to ignore the event or obtain rewards at the cost of triggering a trap.

Options after the trap is triggered are:
 * Take damage equal to 25% max HP
 * 50% chance to take damage equal to 40% max HP
 * Obtain Pain curse.
The rewards from this event are a random combination of gold, cards, potions, and/or relics.

If the player has Cursed Key, they can choose to obtain a random curse rather than trigger the trap.

If the player has Matryoshka, they can use one charge of it to get twice as many rewards.

### Dead Man's Rings
Any-stage event.

The player can choose to ignore the event, or find relics with a risk to become cursed.

The first two options give 1 relic, and a 50% chance to recieve a curse. The curses each one offers are different each time the event is encountered, chosen randomly.

The third option gives 2 relics, and has a 75% chance to recieve a random curse. Unlike the first two options, you can't tell what curse you'll get from this option before you select it.

Only certain relics can be recieved from this event (see Event Relics).
