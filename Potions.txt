Potions now work on a rarity system. 
There are 5 main rarities: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Ultra Rare, and Shop-Only.

The way potions are selected works differently than it does with relics.
With relics, a random rarity tier is selected, then a random relic is selected from that tier.
With potions, the rarity of a potion just alters its chance of being selected. 
This prevents the frequency you see a potion being affected by certain tiers being too full or empty.

======Potion rarity frequency ratio======
Common: 9
Uncommon: 7
Rare: 4
Ultra Rare: 1 (3 in shops)
Shop-Only: 0 (10 in shops)

======Average potion price in shops======
Common: 50g
Uncommon: 60g
Rare: 75g
Ultra Rare: 90g
Shop-Only: 40g
